  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, LEONARDO, MEGA, and ZERO 
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN takes care 
  of use the correct LED pin whatever is the board used.
  
  The MICRO does not have a LED_BUILTIN available. For the MICRO board please substitute
  the LED_BUILTIN definition with either LED_BUILTIN_RX or LED_BUILTIN_TX.
  e.g. pinMode(LED_BUILTIN_RX, OUTPUT); etc.
  
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the Technical Specs of your board  at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
  
  This example code is in the public domain.
